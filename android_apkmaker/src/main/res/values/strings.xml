        The only source for new apps that your device knows is your app store.  But this app
        is going to build a app for you right here on your device.  To install
        that new app, you need to tell your device to allow installation of apps from
        unknown sources.
        \n\nEnabling Unknown Sources does not allow apps to be installed without your
        explicit case by case consent.  You will still be shown a list of special permissions
        requested by an app and asked if you want to install it. You should always pay close attention
        to the permissions list, especially if you\'re allowing unknown sources.
        \n\nClicking "OK" will take you to the settings screen where you can check the box to
        allow "Unknown Sources."
